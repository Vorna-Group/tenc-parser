TENCparser Source-Available License

Copyright (c) 2025 Vorna Group LLC

Permission is granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this
software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to use, copy,
modify, and distribute the Software subject to the terms below.

This is a source-available license, not an open-source license.

1. Revenue Threshold (Free Use Tier)

- You may use the Software without charge if your total annual gross revenue
  (or your employing entity’s) for the most recently completed fiscal year is
  less than USD $150,000. This includes individuals, hobbyists, students,
  open-source projects, small businesses, academic research, personal tools,
  and nonprofits below the threshold.
- If your annual gross revenue is USD $150,000 or more, you must obtain a paid
  commercial license from Vorna Group LLC before using the Software in any
  production system, internal business context, commercial product,
  revenue‑associated environment, hosted/automated pipeline, or service
  delivered to third parties.

2. Definition of Commercial Use

“Commercial Use” means any use by or for a business entity, organization,
government entity, a nonprofit meeting or exceeding the Revenue Threshold, or
an individual engaged in revenue‑generating activity. Commercial Use explicitly
includes:
  a) internal business tools and infrastructure;
  b) research, prototyping, or R&D by an entity over the Revenue Threshold;
  c) free products monetized by ads, sponsorships, data, or upsells;
  d) SaaS applications, hosted tools, or cloud services;
  e) consulting, outsourcing, or managed services;
  f) usage by nonprofits whose revenue meets the threshold.

Noncommercial Use does not include any of the above.

3. SaaS / Hosted / API Restriction

You may not provide the Software, or any modified version of it, as a public
hosted service, a public cloud service, a public SaaS platform, or any form of
public API (REST, GraphQL, RPC, CLI‑over‑HTTP, etc.) unless you obtain a paid
commercial license.

Examples of restricted public use:
- “TENCparser‑as‑a‑Service”
- public parsing/validation APIs
- cloud‑based conversion tools
- any public endpoints where external users submit data
- embedding into a hosted platform as a feature for end users
- using the Software as a backend for a service processing third‑party data

3.1 Internal Use Exception (Below Revenue Threshold)

The restriction in Section 3 does not apply to purely internal, non‑public,
non‑customer‑facing use by organizations below the Revenue Threshold. Internal
use means employees or contractors of the same organization accessing the
Software through internal tooling, servers, or private APIs, not exposed to
clients, customers, external users, or the public. Internal use remains fully
subject to all other terms of this License.

3.2 Commercial Use Above Revenue Threshold

If your organization’s annual revenue is USD $150,000 or more, you must obtain
a commercial license before deploying the Software in internal hosted services,
exposing it through internal/private/public APIs, integrating it into hosted
or cloud products, or using it in pipelines that serve paying customers
(directly or indirectly).

3.3 No Redistribution as a Service

Regardless of revenue, you may not resell, wrap, embed, or bundle the Software
as a service; integrate it as a feature of a hosted platform; provide it as a
cloud tool where third parties submit data; or sublicense/rebundle the
Software in any way, without a commercial license.

4. Distribution of Modified Versions

You may modify the Software, but:
- any distributed modified or derivative version must retain this License in full;
- you may not relicense under MIT, Apache, GPL, or any OSI license;
- you may not remove, change, or replace this licensing text.

Modification does not permit: relicensing, dual‑licensing, stripping
restrictions, or converting it into another library under different terms.

5. Definition of Derivative Works

A “Derivative Work” includes: any modification or adaptation of the Software;
reimplementations informed by Software design, structure, or output; clean‑room
reimplementations influenced by behavior or documentation; translations or
ports; or code using the Software’s structure as its basis.

All Derivative Works must be distributed only under this License.

6. Revenue Verification

Upon written request, you must provide documentation verifying your annual
gross revenue solely for confirming compliance. Requests must be infrequent,
reasonable, and narrowly scoped to revenue verification only.

7. Termination

All rights granted by this License terminate immediately if you:
  a) exceed the Revenue Threshold without obtaining a commercial license;
  b) violate any restriction in Sections 2–6;
  c) distribute the Software improperly; or
  d) offer it as a hosted/cloud/SaaS/API service in violation of Section 3.

Rights may be restored only if you correct the violation and obtain written
reinstatement from Vorna Group LLC.

8. Attribution

All copies (modified or unmodified) must include this License text in full and
all copyright notices.

9. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE SOFTWARE OR ITS USE.

10. Definitions

(taxes excluded).
